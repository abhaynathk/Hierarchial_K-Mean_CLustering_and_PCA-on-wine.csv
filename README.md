# Hierarchial_K-Mean_CLustering_and_PCA-on-wine.csv
K-mean , Hierarchial Clustering and PCA on Wine.csv dataset
Problem Statement: -
Perform hierarchical and K-means clustering on the dataset. After that, perform PCA on the dataset and extract the first 3 principal components and make a new dataset with these 3 principal components as the columns. Now, on this new dataset, perform hierarchical and K-means clustering. Compare the results of clustering on the original dataset and clustering on the principal components dataset (use the scree plot technique to obtain the optimum number of clusters in K-means clustering and check if youâ€™re getting similar results with and without PCA).
